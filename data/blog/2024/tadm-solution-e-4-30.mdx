## Exercise 4-30

### Question

Consider again the problem of merging $k$ sorted length-$n$ arrays into a single
sorted length-$kn$ array. Consider the algorithm that first divides the $k$ arrays
into $k/2$ pairs of arrays, and uses the merge subroutine to combine each pair,
resulting in $k/2$ sorted length-$2n$ arrays. The algorithm repeats this step until
there is only one length-kn sorted array. What is the running time as a function
of $n$ and $k$?

### Solution

Let $h$ be the height og the repetition operation of merging of two arrays of equal length.  
By using the same analysis of Mergesort, the constraint of $h$ is:

$$
\begin{equation}
2^{k-1} < k < 2^k \implies h=\lceil\lg{k}\rceil
\end{equation}
$$

In each height of repetition, merging takes $O(kn)$ time.

So, Running-time is $O(kn\log{k})$.
