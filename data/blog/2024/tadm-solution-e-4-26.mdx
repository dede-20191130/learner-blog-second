## Exercise 4-26

### Question

Define the recursion depth of quicksort as the maximum number of successive
recursive calls it makes before hitting the base case. What are the minimum
and maximum possible recursion depths for randomized quicksort?

### Solution

#### Minimum depth

All pivots are median and the length of subarrays is exactly half of the original.  
So $depth=\lceil\lg{n}\rceil$

#### Maximum depth

All pivots are the edge value of the array and the larger length of the two subarrays is only one less than the original.  
So $depth=n-1$
