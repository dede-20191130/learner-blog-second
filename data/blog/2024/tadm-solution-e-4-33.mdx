## Exercise 4-33

### Question

Show that n positive integers in the range 1 to k can be sorted in $O(n \log {k})$
time. The interesting case is when $k Â« n$.

### Solution

#### Outline

Construct binary search tree in which each node has the integer and
count nunber what times the integer appears in the array.

The height of the tree is $O(\log{k})$ and counting one element of the array
takes $O(\log{k})$ time.

After all counting, reconstruct the array based on the data in the tree.

Time complexity: $O(n\log{k})$

#### Code

```cpp
