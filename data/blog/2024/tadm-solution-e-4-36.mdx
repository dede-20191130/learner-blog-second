## Exercise 4-36

### Question

Assume that the array $A[1..n]$ only has numbers from $\{1,...,n^2\}$ but that
at most log log n of these numbers ever appear. Devise an algorithm that sorts
A in substantially less than $O(n \log {n})$.

### Solution

First, we count the occurence of each number using hash table. Since the amount of the numbers existing in the array is considerably small, the procedure can be considered to take $O(n)$ time.

Then, we sort those numbers and arrange them by the number of their occurrences. This takes $O(\log{(\log{n})}\log{(\log{(\log{n})})})$ time.

So the overall time complexity is $O(n)$.
