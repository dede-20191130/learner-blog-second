## Exercise 2-39

### Question

An unsorted array of size n contains distinct integers between $1$ and $n + 1$,
with one element missing. Give an $O(n)$ algorithm to find the missing integer,
without using any extra space.

### Solution

C++ code with explanation comments.

```cpp
#include <vector>
int find_missing(const std::vector<int>& missing_array) {
    int n{(int)missing_array.size()};

    // calc sum of not-missing array using summation formula
    int desired_sum = (n + 1) * (n + 2) / 2;

    // sum one by one from the array
    // O(n)
    int current_sum{0};
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        current_sum += missing_array[i];
    }

    return desired_sum - current_sum;
}
```
